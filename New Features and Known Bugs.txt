New in verson 3.00

* As version's 1 & 2 were never released officially due to major bug
  problems most features are new to version 3.00
* Better error handling
* Front Cover & Inside Jacket (Separate) option
* More accurate printing
* Improved Interface
* Print Copies option, enabling user to print more than 1 copy of each
  cover, also joint print option i.e. Print Front & Back Cover etc

Known Bugs in version 3.00

* When a file is double clicked in the Open dialog box the box 
  re-appears, this is due to the position of the Cover box itself.
  This problem is almost fixed an update should be out soon

* If Scroll.txt file is not in the application path the program will
  not load, again a small problem that is being worked on


Compatibility problems

* None that I'm aware of but CDP has only been tested on 4 PC's and
  2 Epson printers


If you find more bugs  or compatability problems please e-mail me so 
I can keep improving CDP
